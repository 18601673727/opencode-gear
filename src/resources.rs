//! The durable, descriptive Resource Registry.
//!
//! The registry answers *what execution resources does OCG know about, what
//! facts are known about each, where did those facts come from, how fresh are
//! they, and what capabilities and availability are known*. It deliberately
//! does **not** answer *which resource should a Mission use*: that is future
//! Policy / Placement work. Nothing here selects, ranks, scores, rotates or
//! fails over a resource.
//!
//! Three identities stay mechanically distinct:
//!
//! ```text
//! MissionId          durable work identity        (orchestration::mission)
//! ResourceId         execution-capable resource   (this module)
//! RuntimeExecutionId one concrete execution       (runtime::lifecycle)
//! ```
//!
//! Unknown is a first-class state. When OCG has no authoritative source for a
//! value the fact stays [`ResourceProvenance::Unknown`] with no value; missing
//! evidence is never turned into an optimistic `0`, `unlimited`, `available`
//! or `healthy`. The four states Configured / Resolved / Effective / Observed
//! are kept apart instead of being collapsed because they currently agree.
//!
//! Persistence is a single bounded, atomically written JSON document under
//! `<project>/.opencode-gear/resources/registry.json`. Only dynamic
//! observations are persisted; configured facts are re-derived from the
//! effective configuration on every load, so configuration is never duplicated
//! as stale durable truth. A corrupt record is reported and skipped without
//! poisoning unrelated resources, and never silently becomes "resource absent".
