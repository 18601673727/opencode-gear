//! Deterministic project-boundary resolution.
//!
//! A project is *initialized* by the presence of a marker file
//! (`.opencode-gear.yaml`) in a directory. The project root is the nearest
//! ancestor of the invocation directory that contains the marker. Every piece
//! of project-scoped state (context index/cache, orchestration state,
//! checkpoints, verification logs, the generated plugin and local telemetry)
//! is placed under that resolved root, never under an arbitrary working
//! directory. Two sibling projects therefore can never share state, and a
//! parent directory that is not itself a project can never become a boundary
//! for a child project.
//!
//! Resolution is purely local and deterministic: the filesystem is walked
//! upwards and paths are canonicalized before any comparison. No workspace
//! database, registry or cache is introduced. There is no global fallback that
//! could merge unrelated projects.
