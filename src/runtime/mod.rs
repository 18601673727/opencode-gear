//! Managed OpenCode runtime.
//!
//! The runtime layer answers one question for a launch: which `opencode`
//! executable should run? The answer is one of four sources, in a fixed
//! precedence:
//!
//! 1. an explicit executable (environment override),
//! 2. an existing managed project runtime,
//! 3. a usable system `opencode` on `PATH`,
//! 4. a project-local bootstrap install.
//!
//! Policy lives in the top-level `runtime` configuration object; the existing
//! raw `opencode` config key is never overloaded.
