//! OpenCode runtime compatibility boundary.
//!
//! Gear supports two structurally different OpenCode major families:
//!
//! ```text
//! runtime/common contract
//! ├── v1 adapter   (1.18.x: `plugin`, `task`, request-scoped Lead)
//! └── v2 adapter   (2.0.x: `plugin`, `subagent`, session-scoped Lead)
//! ```
//!
//! Every version-specific decision lives here. No unrelated module may branch
//! on the OpenCode major version: callers ask for the detected [`Major`], get an
//! adapter from [`adapter_for`], and use the adapter's contract. The two
//! adapters are deliberately thin data+behaviour; all policy (which model, which
//! variant, who may run what) stays in Rust.
//!
//! Detection is explicit. [`detect`] parses an `opencode --version` string and
//! fails clearly for a structurally incompatible major (for example `3.x` or a
//! `1.x` below the [`v1_floor`]). A runtime whose version genuinely cannot be
//! determined is *unclassified* and callers fall back to the v1 contract to
//! preserve the historical 1.18.x launch path.
