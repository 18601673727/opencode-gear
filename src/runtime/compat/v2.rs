//! OpenCode 2.x adapter.
//!
//! OpenCode 2 changes the surrounding shape, not Gear's policy:
//!
//! - local plugins are discovered from `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/plugins`, not from
//!   a config array entry,
//! - the v1 `task` tool/permission key became `subagent`,
//! - the runtime is a daemon reached over HTTP/SSE; Gear selects the Lead on
//!   the *session* (create/resolve, switch agent/model/variant, verify) rather
//!   than by rewriting a request message,
//! - `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` remains the supported way to hand Gear's
//!   generated config to the runtime.
//!
//! The generated adapter stays deliberately thin: it only transports dynamic
//! context and hand-offs. Session-level Lead policy, model choice and variant
//! resolution stay in Rust.
