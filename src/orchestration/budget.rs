//! Mandatory Mission monetary budget and quota admission.
//!
//! This module is the **economic safety boundary** of the control plane. It
//! answers exactly one question before any provider-costly side effect:
//!
//! ```text
//! given this Mission's durable budget,
//!       this proposed bounded spend,
//!       the current quota facts,
//! may OCG intentionally start this provider-costly work?
//! ```
//!
//! Two properties make it different from the optional Policy layer:
//!
//! 1. **It is not bypassable.** A configured hard Mission budget is a cutoff,
//!    not an alert. The admission is evaluated independently of
//!    `policy.enabled`, and a generic approval can never authorize exceeding a
//!    hard cap. The only way past a cap is to explicitly change the hard budget
//!    itself (`ocg budget set`).
//! 2. **Unknown never becomes optimistic.** When a cost or quota fact is
//!    required for economic safety and is unknown or stale, the action is
//!    deferred rather than assumed free, unlimited or available. No currency is
//!    ever converted.
//!
//! Money is a fixed-point integer (micro-units of a single currency), never a
//! binary float. Spend is durably reserved before the side effect and settled
//! once afterwards, so a crash, restart, rollover, retry or recovery pass
//! cannot double-count a bounded spend. An uncertain dispatch keeps its
//! reservation rather than optimistically releasing it.
//!
//! The module owns only the budget model and its pure decision function. It
//! performs no runtime side effect and no network I/O; the registry read used
//! for quota facts is a descriptive, fail-soft lookup.
