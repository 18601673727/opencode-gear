//! Orchestration: typed role hand-offs, durable Mission state, a local
//! controller, and the generated OpenCode plugin adapter. Runtime execution
//! mechanics enter through the neutral `runtime::lifecycle` boundary; OpenCode
//! protocol details stay in the concrete adapter.
//!
//! This module owns durable, inspectable hand-offs between phases. It does not
//! own the conversation or the model loop — OpenCode does. The Rust controller
//! is the authority; the JavaScript adapter generated at launch is a thin
//! transport that only carries bytes to and from `ocg __bridge`.
//!
//! State lives under `.opencode-gear/orchestration/` (ignored local state) and
//! checkpoints stay under `.opencode-gear/checkpoints/`.
//!
//! Two different lifetimes share that directory:
//!
//! - **Sessions are disposable execution state** (`state.json`): bounded,
//!   evicted, keyed by the OpenCode session id, recoverable-to-empty on
//!   corruption.
//! - **Missions are durable product state** (`missions/<mission_id>.json`):
//!   the versioned record of one admitted task, independent of any session,
//!   strictly versioned and quarantined on corruption.
