//! The Rust orchestration controller.
//!
//! This is where every orchestration decision is made. The generated JavaScript
//! adapter is intentionally inert: it only carries bytes between OpenCode and
//! this controller through `ocg __bridge`. Context ranking, projection, policy,
//! freshness, retry budgets, checkpointing and telemetry all live here.
//!
//! ```text
//! chat.message      -> prepare_lead_context   (V1 persisted dynamic context suffix)
//! session.prompt    -> admit_user_task        (V2 genuine prompt admission: task identity)
//! session.context   -> prepare_model_context  (V2 model-dispatch repository baseline)
//! task before       -> prepare_handoff        (typed role projection)
//! task after        -> consume_explore_result (bounded findings + checkpoint)
//!                   -> after_build            (verification + retry/debug policy)
//! ```
//!
//! Invariants:
//!
//! - No arbitrary shell. Verification uses the existing trusted, structured
//!   `verification` configuration and the shared [`CaptureRunner`].
//! - Fail-soft state. A corrupt state, checkpoint or cache is skipped and
//!   reported, never fatal, and never silently reused.
//! - No learned router. The only inputs are explicit config and deterministic
//!   local evidence.
