//! Durable Mission state: the product-state boundary above sessions.
//!
//! A **session is disposable execution state**. It lives in
//! `.opencode-gear/orchestration/state.json`, keyed by the OpenCode session
//! id, bounded and evicted; it can be dropped, compacted, rolled over or
//! replaced at any time without losing work.
//!
//! A **Mission is durable product state**: the versioned record of one
//! admitted task, keyed by `mission_id` (the deterministic task id derived
//! from the admitted task text — never from a session). It survives the
//! death, failure, compaction, replacement or rollover of any individual
//! OpenCode/model session:
//!
//! - progress is written per mission under
//!   `.opencode-gear/orchestration/missions/<mission_id>.json`, atomically
//!   (temp sibling + rename), alongside — never instead of — the session
//!   view;
//! - the current OpenCode session is recorded as `session_id`, a
//!   **replaceable execution binding**, not part of Mission identity;
//! - a fresh session that admits the same task binds to the same Mission
//!   and is seeded from it, so committed work (findings, attempts,
//!   checkpoints, verification) is never replayed from zero;
//! - `completed`, `failed` and `cancelled` are typed terminal states;
//! - a bounded history of consequential transitions (admission, session
//!   binding, checkpointed hand-offs, terminal states) carries a
//!   deterministic event identity each, so replaying the same transition
//!   identity is a no-op instead of a duplicate effect.
//!
//! Corruption is handled strictly, unlike the disposable session state: a
//! corrupt or unsupported Mission record is **quarantined** (renamed to
//! `<mission_id>.corrupt.json`, preserving the bytes for inspection) and the
//! load fails explicitly. It never silently reads as "no Mission", which
//! would restart committed work from scratch.
//!
//! The controller keeps the session view and the Mission in sync at every
//! mutation point; between them the Mission is authoritative. Single-owner
//! semantics still apply: reconciling two *concurrently live* sessions bound
//! to one Mission is deferred to the reconciliation work that builds on this
//! foundation.
