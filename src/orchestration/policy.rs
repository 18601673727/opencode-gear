//! Policy / Admission Engine.
//!
//! The Policy layer answers exactly one question:
//!
//! ```text
//! given this Mission,
//!       this proposed control-plane action,
//!       these current durable/runtime/resource facts,
//! is the action allowed to proceed?
//! ```
//!
//! It does **not** answer *which resource should be used*. That is future
//! Placement / Resource Broker work and deliberately not implemented here.
//! Policy evaluates the action's admissibility for the **currently associated**
//! resource; it never enumerates, ranks, scores, rotates or fails over.
//!
//! The decision vocabulary is small and typed:
//!
//! ```text
//! Allow            proceed with the planned action
//! Defer            not currently safe; keep durable state, retry later
//! RequireApproval  needs an explicit, generation-bound approval
//! Deny             never proceed for this action/context
//! ```
//!
//! Rules are evaluated in a deterministic order and aggregated by an explicit
//! precedence (`Deny > RequireApproval > Defer > Allow`). The winning rule is
//! recorded, so a caller can always answer *why was this allowed/blocked?*.
//!
//! Policy is transport-neutral: it consumes only durable Mission metadata,
//! runtime-neutral capability facts, registry facts and a pre-resolved approval
//! view. No OpenCode HTTP/event type enters this module.
//!
//! Unknown is respected. A rule declares which facts it actually requires, and
//! an unknown required fact is never interpreted optimistically:
//! `unknown quota != unlimited`, `unknown capacity != available`,
//! `unknown cost != free`, `unknown health != healthy`, and a stale fact is not
//! treated as a current fact. A rule that does not require a fact is never
//! blocked by it being unknown.
